My Timed Coding Quiz:

Overview
I'm tasked with creating a timed coding quiz with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The quiz should include multiple-choice questions and be user-friendly. Below are some of the specific requirements my application had to meet:

When I click the "start" button, a timer begins, and I see the first question.

After answering a question, I receive the next question.

If I answer a question incorrectly, time is deducted from the timer.

The game ends when I've answered all questions or when the timer runs out.

When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.

Possible Challenges:
Challenges may include data structuring, handling user interaction, scoring, and making the quiz responsive.

I used the following techniques/practices I followed to ensure this challenge went smoothly:
Starting with a wireframe.
Testing the application frequently and addressing issues promptly.
Making frequent git commits to help keep track of changes.
Keeping the code organized and well-commented.
Use online resources and communities for guidance.

Below is a screenshot of my finished product along with a link to my repo and deployed web page:
